## Here we will see a practical implementation of ANN at beginners level

An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that mimics the way nerve cells work in the human brain.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) use learning algorithms that can independently make adjustments - or learn, in a sense - as they receive new input. This makes them a very effective tool for non-linear statistical data modeling.
